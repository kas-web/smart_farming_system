A prototype to detect overwater and underwater condition of crops

This project aims to enhance agricultural practices by developing advanced technologies for detecting and monitoring plant health in both overwater and underwater environments. Key objectives include:

Plant Detection: Create systems to identify and monitor plant conditions in flooded fields and submerged crops.
Data Collection: Utilize sensors, drones, and underwater robotics to gather real-time data on plant health, soil moisture, and nutrient levels.
AI Integration: Implement machine learning algorithms to analyze data and provide actionable insights for farmers.
Resource Optimization: Develop strategies for efficient water and nutrient management to improve crop yields and sustainability.
By leveraging technology, the project seeks to empower farmers, promote sustainable practices, and enhance food security in challenging environments.
